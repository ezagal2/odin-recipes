    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pepperjack cheese and strawberry preserves mingle on this turkey sandwich for a sweet and savory lunch. Reviewer Jillian says, "I would have never thought to pair turkey, pepperjack cheese, and strawberry preserves but this definitely works and is a nice departure from your 'run of the mill' turkey sandwich."</p>
